    The campus of BANDHGORA ANCHAL (X-CLASS) VIDYALAYA (H.S) is situated at Gai-Chandra Village under the newly created District of Jhargram. The area is a place of natural beauty. The Vidyalaya is set up in a campus of 4.22 acres of land donated by the under-privileged Chalak(s). In 1965, the retired Principal named Sri Panchkari Dey felt the need of a Vidyalaya for the Villagers of Bandhgora Anchal No.2. The renowned educationist Sri Dey's endeavour resulted in the establishment of the Vidyalaya at Gai-Chandra with a view to spread education in a backward area. The School building was started in 1965. Founded on 01/01/1965, BAVHS grew into education centre , offering to the Madhyamik passed students a whole array of subjects from two disciplines of Arts & Science. The Vidyalaya is affiliated to WBBSE (1965) & WBCHSE(2005). Computer and internet facility is available for the staff and the students within the campus. Our Campus is equipped with water purifiers to provide safe drinking water to students and staff. Our Vidyalaya has the VISHAKHA committee. The whole campus is under CC.camera surveillance.
